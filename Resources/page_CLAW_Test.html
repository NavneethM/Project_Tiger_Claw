      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      We are aware that you can easily cheat and find all of the answers, but that only hurts you. So lets get started.<br>
      First you will need to download all of the files into the same folder.<br>
      Next, once all of the files are downloaded you can open the "Test.py" and begin.<br>
      <br>
      Your windows computer may or may not have python 3 installed already, if it does not you can visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download the latest version.<br>
      Most *Nix OSs will have python3 already installed. If you want you use a *Nix then using a VM might be your best option if you don't run "Nix nativelly.<br>
      <br>
      Congratulations, barring that eveything in the above steps worked you have now started the test. You can select a category you would like to study by following the prompts, and selecting the number that corresponds with the catagory. You can also select "Multi" and select multiple numbers of quizzes, or select the "All" options to get a varity of all of the questions.<br>
      After selecting the category you have the option to select how many questions from that category you want to attempt. If you choose a number that is greater than the number of questions in that category you will just det all of the questions.<br>
      This quizzer also has the option to do Test or Practice mode. If you choose test mode then you will not be able to retry incorrect answers, but with practice mode you are able to choose how many retries you would like to get.<br>
      There are three ways to answer multiple choice questions. You may type out the answer completely, you may enter the letter (A,B,C,D), or you may enter a number that corresponds with the letter (1=A, 2=B, etc.). None of the answer are case sensitive you a is the same as A.<br>
      If you see a question that has (XXXX) or (#####) that means that the answer should be in that format, where X would be letters and # would be numbers. It does not represent how many letters and numbers you will have to enter though.<br>
      Good luck, and please message <strong>(insert POCs here)</strong> if you have any issues and we can fix them.<br>
